## readwithme-ios
==============

This app was built between 2012 and 2014 and was available for a few years afterwards in the Apple iTunes App store. It is the companion app to the web version. Both of these apps are no longer live, but the code here remains for legacy purposes. 



The iOS app was built pre-Swift, all in Objective-C and was the first full production app that I was able to monetize successfully for the eduation market. It was built when I was a schoolteacher conducting reading assessments on paper and pencil, which left me wondering if a better way to assess fluency was possible using the then-new iPad.

I have not installed this app on any new Macs or modern versions of XCode, so I don't expect anyone to try. But thanks for stopping by!

### Project notes
The App extended the web version by providing native device features like accessing the Front-facing camera to record and save reading sessions with parents or other educators. A promo video of the fully app can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9FGE7H4edM).
