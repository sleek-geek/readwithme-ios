<h1> About Read With Me</h1> <hr>
 
    
       <p> <img  src="Readwmelogo.png"   height="300" style="float:left"> Read With Me was developed by teachers interested in making oral reading fluency assessing a more streamlined and informative process. We wanted to build a mobile app that allowed us to record and share a student's oral reading with parents or other teachers using whatever text we chose. Ultimately, we felt that we spent too much class time assessing and not enough time addressing the needs that our assessments revealed. </p> <p>We hope you agree that Read With Me is a faster and more flexible way of conducting oral fluency assessments, no matter what your needs are. Whether you are a homeschooling parent, or a reading specialist working with special needs students, or a general classroom teacher who cares about valuable data and reading progress, we hope that you will find Read With Me an invaluable addition to your digital toolbox.  </p>

<h3> Read With Me for the iPad </h3> 
        <p>Read With Me for the iPad has both online and offline versions.  This way you have more options on how to conduct assessments, as well as view and track reading progress. The iPad app also has more features available that are not in the web-only version, the most exciting of these being video recording.   </p > <p> Not only can you record your students reading aloud but you can also review their performance against a report that can be shared with parents or other teachers. Students can also watch and listen to their own reading performance, making the debriefing process more meaningful for all.  </p><p>Read With Me can be used in the following ways:</p>

                <img  src="1plusLS.png"   width="600"><br><br><hr>
                    <img  src="2offlineLS.png"   width="600"><br><br><hr>
                        <img  src="1offlineLS.png"   width="600"><br><br><hr>
    </center>
        
        
        <p> The Read With Me Fluency iPad app comes with access to the web-based version.  If you've purchased the iPad app then you have access to the web-based version, but not vice versa.  Once you download the iPad app you may automatically access your classes, passages, and reports already in the web-based version.
        
        </p>
         <p> The Offline Teacher mode allows you to work offline and assess reading without an internet connection or a Read With Me account. It offers many of the same features available on the web version.  </p>
        
     
    
    <h3> Our Library    </h3>
        <p> The Read With Me library comes with three original passages per grade level. We use The Lexile&#174;
        Framework for Reading, which is a scientific approach to measuring reading ability
        and the text demand of reading materials. (see below).    </p>  
     
    
    <h3>Basic Scoring Guidelines </h3>
    <p>Unlike most reading assessment programs that have only one way to assess reading fluency,  Read With Me was built to let user determine a preferred methodology. Based on research done by the University of Oregon around oral reading benchmarks and progress per grade level, as well as other bodies of research, we hope to bring the best from many styles and programs you may be familiar with.   </p>
    <h4> How to score: </h4>
                <p> Tap on a word to bring up the menu of miscues. Select the error </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Graphophonic: errors of letter-sound relationship. A student reads 'brit' when reading the word "bright".  </li>
        <li>Semantic: errors of meaning or vocabulary. A student reads 'play' when reading word "playing"</li>
        <li>Skipped: a word that is omitted. To count as miscue see "Settings" screen. The default is YES</li>
        <li>Help: teacher or evaluator provided word. To count as miscue see "Settings" screen. The default is YES.</li>
        <li>Self-Correct: A student self-corrected a miscue. This does not count against student correct word per minute score.</li>
        
        <p>Please refer to our more detailed "Scoring Guidelines and Suggestions" document included in the app for more information on scoring and other considerations.</p>
        
        </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Timer options </h3>
        <p>Both the online and offline evaluator modes include one-minute and stopwatch modes. In one-minute mode the clock will count up to 1:00 and automatically end the assessments. The evaluator will be prompted to select the last word by tapping. When using the one minute mode, comprehension is disabled by default. If you intend to use comprehension questions, make sure student has completed the whole passage.
        </p>
        <p>Once the evaluator presses START button, the timer mode cannot be changed unless a new assessment is created. </p>
        
   <h3>Comprehension Questions</h3>
        <p>Most of the Read With Me passages include comprehension questions. The evaluator may choose to take these into account when determining the actual level of a student. Read With Me leaves it up to the evaluator to determine if a student's response is satisfactory. We have included a text box in the comprehension view for the evaluator to enter optional student verbal response.
        
        </p><p>Custom Passages: In the offline mode, when creating a custom passage for the library, a teacher or parent can include up to three comprehension questions. These will be available to the student in the Offline Student mode. Viewing comprehension questions on the student screen will hide the passage text. </p>
        
        <h3>Video recording </h3>
            
            <p>For synced online assessments, a student's reading may be video recorded through the iPad's front-facing camera. It is not necessary for a student's face to fully appear in the small window as the video records at a wider angle than is actually represented. If a student finds this feature distracting, it may be hidden by tapping the window.</p>
            <p>By default, videos automatically saved to the iPad and can be viewed in the picture gallery and synced with your computer like any video. If disk space is a concern, video saving can be disabled in the Settings screen.</p>
            <p> Note: The video recording feature is only available in iPads with a front-facing camera and iOS 5 or higher.
            </p>
         <h3>Copyrighted passages </h3>
            <p>Read With Me allows you to enter or copy/paste your own custom texts for use in your assessments. If you are not the author of the text or content you are entering or pasting into the app, please make sure to check the terms of use of the publisher or copyright holder of the text(s) in question to see if you can make digital copies for personal use. Under no condition should you violate the terms of the copyright holder of any texts you wish to use and Read With Me is not liable for any vioations that may occur.
            </p>
     
   

        
    <h3>Benchmark and Norms </h3>
    <p>Read With Me is aligned to the National Fluency Norms developed by the University of Oregon. We have aligned our benchmarks to the recommendations made by these studies.   </p>
    <p> A student's benchmark score is determined by their grade level, the time of year (Fall, Winter, Spring), and their oral reading fluency score as measured by the correct words per minute they read in a grade-appropriate text.  </p>
    <ul><li>Above benchmark: Student scores in the top 25% of average for grade level </li>
        <li>Benchmark: Scoring in 25% to 50% range for grade level </li>
        <li>Approaching: Scoring between 75% and 50% for the grade level. These students should receive some intervention.</li>
        <li>Below: Students scoring below the 75% percentile. Intensive intervention is strongly recommended. </li>
        </ul>
     
        
<h3>Lexile&#174;</h3>
        <p>A Lexile measure represents both the complexity of a text, such as
        a book or article, and an individual's reading ability. Lexile measures are expressed as
        numeric measures followed by an "L"(for example, 850L), and are placed on the Lexile
        scale. The Lexile scale is a developmental scale for measuring reader ability and text
        complexity,ranging from below 200L for beginning readers and beginning-reader materials
        to above 1600L for advanced readers and materials. Knowing the Lexile measures of a
        reader and a text helps to predict how the text matches the reader's ability-whether it
        may be too easy, too difficult or just right.</p>
